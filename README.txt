This project was based off my wanting to become a better C programmer. Albeit, I am posting this code specailly for DePaul University Computer Science students. If your taking CSC 373 and CSC 374 your projects will be based off this code. I don't claim it to be perfect or 1 for 1 answers (I know they are not). While I'm reading the Linux Bible I will be posting Data Structures and Algo code in C. If your willing to translate it to java It will help you out a lot in CSC 301 and 302. Last, I will be posting the SQL homework and answers or CSC 353 and CSC 355. I'm doing most of this just to flip off the admins of DePaul University so you can trust if you find a problem with the code and you need it for homework Email me or reach out on Instagram or FaceBook I'll personly make it a before it's do.
